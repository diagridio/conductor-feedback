Conductor automates the management of Dapr on Kubernetes while increasing observability, reliability and security. Conductor enables you to run Dapr in any environment, from development to production, with confidence. Conductor is especially useful as your Dapr usage scales, with management capabilities that span across multiple Kubernetes clusters, regardless of where they are hosted.
